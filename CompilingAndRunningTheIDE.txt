Compiling the IDE

1. Run qmake for the OSLD.
1. Compile the OSLD to obtain the libOSLD.so library.
2. Run qmake for the IDE.
3. Attempt to compile the IDE to create the build directory - This should fail.
4. Copy libOSLD.so and all .h files (9) from the OSLD project to the created IDE build directory.
5. Add the libOSLD.so file to the IDE Qt project in Qt Creator.
6. Rebuild the IDE - This should build successfully this time.
7. Open terminal in the build directory and run the IDE using ./IDE

Same basic process should apply for the OSLDisplay and Stimulator as well.
